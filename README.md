# serverless-demo-ruby
Working through the demo ruby server API https://serverless.com/blog/api-ruby-serverless-framework/

IF you never worked with AWS you need to do init set up at https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/

* I have worked already to set up my AWS keys 
* Added my credit card
* Used the serverless CLI to do all the leg work so far
* Working through the issue  of `ServerlessError: The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service`
